## A basic python script that utilizes yt-dlp to create a simple, yet very effective Discord bot.

This script runs a Discord bot that listens for youtube links, downloads their respective vidoes as an audio file at 128K quality, then broadcasts the file to your discord server's voice channel.

This bot will continue to work, as long as you keep your yt-dlp program up to date as YouTube's API changes over time.

## This script has the following pip dependencies:<br/>
**<sub>discord.py<br/>
yt-dlp<br/>
ffmpeg<br/>
asyncio<br/>
PyNaCl</sub>**

Enter your Discord bot token at the end of the script, then you're good to go.
